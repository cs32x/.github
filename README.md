# Welcome

This organization shares the code repositories for learners who take our online version of CS32x, which will be soon available through HarvardX. CS32x builds on our experience with CS32 that over a thousand Harvard College students have taken.

We created CS32 for anyone who needs computation for their job, major, or personal life. If you have zero background in computer science or the art of computer programming, but you want to learn, you've come to the right place.

Both courses partner well with the book: [_Problem Solving with Python: Using Computational Thinking in Everyday Life_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262552844/problem-solving-with-python/) from MIT Press. This book, like our courses, shows you how to solve problems with computation, and they set you on the road to becoming an expert in this increasingly important skill.

If you're a teacher interested in offering your own course that uses our material, please feel free to contact us.
